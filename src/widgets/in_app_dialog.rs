//! In-app dialogs: modal panels drawn **inside** the main window.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A `gtk::Window` is a real top-level window. On a tiling compositor (Sway)
//! that means the compositor owns it: it can be tiled beside the app, sent to
//! another workspace, or left behind when you switch. None of that is what a
//! modal dialog means. `app.rs` already had a float layer for exactly this
//! reason, but only half the dialogs used it.
//!
//! # Why it is not the `app.rs` float layer
//!
//! That layer is driven by `AppMsg` and hosts *Relm4 components*. These
//! dialogs are plain functions that take an `on_confirm: impl Fn()` closure,
//! and a closure cannot travel through a `#[derive(Debug)]` message enum. So
//! this helper finds the nearest `gtk::Overlay` by walking up from any widget
//! and adds its own scrim + host to it. No app plumbing, no message round
//! trip, and pages stay unaware of `AppModel`.
//!
//! # Before you change this
//!
//! A `gtk::Window` used to do three things for these dialogs that an overlay
//! does not: destroy the widget tree on close (which breaks the
//! widget-holds-callback-holds-widget cycle), bound their height, and act as a
//! real top-level for portal dialogs. All three are replaced by hand here.
//! `docs/pitfalls.md` §2 explains each one — read it before simplifying
//! `teardown()` or removing a height cap.
//!
//! # Dismissal
//!
//! Three ways out, and the visible one is chosen per dialog:
//!
//! * **The backdrop** — clicking the dimmed area closes it.
//! * **Esc** — always.
//! * **A visible control** — see [`DialogExit`]. Backdrop and Esc are both
//!   *invisible* affordances, so a dialog whose only exits are invisible is
//!   still a trap. Every dialog keeps one visible control; which one depends
//!   on what the dialog *is*, not on habit.

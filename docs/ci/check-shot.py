"""Answer 'did the book covers actually appear?' from a screenshot.

The bug that keeps getting through is a cover that never loads: the card draws
a grey placeholder and simply stays that way. A human sees it instantly. CI
sees a green build.

This closes that gap without needing eyes. The seeded covers are deliberately
saturated colours (see seed-library.py) and the placeholder is grey, so
counting *strongly coloured* pixels is a decent proxy for "covers rendered".

No Pillow, no numpy: adding a pip install to CI for this is not worth the
minute or the supply-chain surface. PNG decoding here is stdlib zlib plus a
hand-rolled unfilter, which is about 60 lines and has no dependencies.

Deliberately reports numbers rather than passing or failing. A threshold
invented today would be a guess, and a wrong threshold that fails a good build
is worse than no threshold at all. Once we have seen a few real runs, a
regression check can compare against a known-good count.
